You can't take it with you when you go
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You can't win them all
You don't know what you've got til its gone
You go to heaven for the weather, and hell for the company
You gotta look out for number one
You just never can tell about some things
You learn something new everyday
You never know who's right, but you always know who's in charge
You only go around once in life
You only live once
You seen one, you've seen them all
You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours
You snooze, you lose
You watch my back, and I'll watch yours
You'd be surprised at what you can live through
You're as young as you feel
You're either part of the solution, or part of the problem
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never too old to learn
Youth is a blunder, manhood a struggle, old age a regret
Youth looks forward, age looks back
Youth will be served
You've got to go along to get along
You've got to walk before you can run
You've got to play the hand you're dealt
Stop and smell the roses along the way
You've never lived, until you've almost died
