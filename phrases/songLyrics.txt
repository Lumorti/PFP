# All Star
Somebody once told me, the world was gonna roll me
She was looking kinda dumb with her finger and her thumb
Hey now, you're an all star
All that glitters is gold

# Seven Nation Army
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back

# Take Me Home, Country Roads
Take me home, country roads

# Wannabe
If you wanna be my lover, gotta get with my friends

# Gives you Hell
When you see my face, hope it gives you hell

# Pumped Up Kicks
All the other kids with their pumped up kicks

# Space Oddity
Ground control to major Tom

# Don't Stop Me Now
That's why they call me Mr Fahrenheit
I wanna make a supersonic man out of you
Don't stop me now, I'm having such a good time
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call

# Bohemian Rhapsody
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Because I'm easy come, easy go
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger now he's dead
Thunderbolts and lightning, very very frightening
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy, from a poor family
